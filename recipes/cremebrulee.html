    <h2>How to make Creme Brulee</h2>
    <p>I learnt how to make Creme Brulee at a restaurant I used to work at. <br>
        I met a pretty girl there who used to talk to me about Creme Brulees so now this dish has a special place in my heart <strong>â™¡</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Creme Brulee is French for <strong>'burnt cream'</strong> which is essentially the gist of a Creme Brulee,<br>
        we make cream, then we coat it in sugar and burn the top. <br>
        I'm not going to go into technical detail with this recipe because part of the fun<br>
        of cooking is figuring it out and learning as you go.<br>
        Cooking is an <em>intuituve</em> art!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs (yolks only)</li>
            <li>cream</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
            <li>vanilla essence</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>seperate your egg yolks from the whites into a bowl (you can save the whites to make a meringue if you desire)</li>
            <li>combine 1 part milk with 3 parts cream into a saucepan</li>
            <li>add 3tsp of vanilla essence into the cream/milk mixture</li>
            <li>put your cream mixture onto a high heat for roughly 6 minutes, you want the mixture to be near a boil<br>
            in order to temper the eggs (once again im not going to go into detail i cbf)</li>
            <li>while your mixture heats up, whisk sugar into the egg yolks (throw in as much sugar as you'd like it's your recipe)</li>
            <li>now that you have an unhealthy amount of sugar in your yolks, your cream should be nice and hot!</li>
            <li>test the heat of your cream by dipping a finger into it, if you don't recieve 3rd degree burns, congratulations! it's time to whisk it all together</li>
            <li>gently whisk the cream mixture into the yolk mixture, do it a little bit at a time or you will cook the eggs and thats no bueno</li>
            <li>once it's all mixed in you will notice bubbles form on the surface of the mixture. kill the bubbles. we don't like bubbles.<br>
                use a ladel to extract the bubbles and put them to the side, you can add these to your whites for a nice meringue if you'd like</li>
            <li>once the bubbles are removed, portion the combined creme mixture into ramekens</li>
            <li>place the ramekens into a bain marie</li>
            <p><strong>HOLD UP</strong>
                <br>WHAT THE F$*K IS A BAIN MARIE?<br>
            my bad, i forget that we cook in the french language for some reason<br>
            a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie">bain marie</em></a> is a special kind of bath where we use water as a sort of insulation to cook the product</p>
            <li>place your ramekens evenly spread out into a deep tray that can hold water</li>
            <li>fill the tray with <strong>hot</strong> water til the water reaches 3/4 up the sides of the ramekens (do not use boiling nor cold water)</li>
            <li>cover your tray (or bain marie hon hon hon) with tinfoil (this is one instance where it is safer to double wrap) <br>
                make sure to tightly insulate the edges of the tray with the tinfoil</li>
                <li>place your tight tinfoil wrapped bain marie into an oven and bake it at 150C for 25mins</li>
                <li>after 25 minutes, pull your creme brulees out, you can check their readiness by giving them a shake.<br>
                they should be gelatinous and bounce back when you lightly touch them, if they seem watery, throw them in for another 5 minutes max</li>
                <li>once your brulees are ready, it's time to cook tf out of them</li>
                <li>sprinkle a desired amount of sugar on the tops of them and blast them with heat from a gas torch</li>
                <p>don't have a gas torch? i've seen a chef use a cigarette lighter to cook the sugar before, not ideal but you gotta do what you gotta do</p>
                <li>your brulees should have a nice brown caramlised top and creamy interior</li>
        </ol>
        <p>if they don't turn out nicely just keep making them again until you get it right. the best way to learn is to f$ck up and do it again. <br>
            also im too lazy to actually put detailed instructions <br>
            <br>
        this webpage is just me practicing programming lol. c'est la vie</p>
